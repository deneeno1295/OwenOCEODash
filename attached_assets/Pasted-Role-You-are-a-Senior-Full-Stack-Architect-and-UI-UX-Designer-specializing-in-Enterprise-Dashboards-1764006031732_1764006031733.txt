Role: You are a Senior Full-Stack Architect and UI/UX Designer specializing in Enterprise Dashboards.

Goal: Build the "OCEO Dashboard," a Competitive Intelligence & Executive Dashboard.

Aesthetic & Branding: The design must mimic a Salesforce.com internal asset (Lightning Design System style).

Theme: "Cosmic" Dark Mode (Enterprise Dark).

Palette: Salesforce Blues (#0176D3 for primary actions), deeply dark slate backgrounds (not pure black), and high-contrast white text.

Components: Use card-based layouts with clean headers, utility bars, and compact data tables. Use "skeuomorphic" depth where appropriate to match enterprise standards.

Font: System sans-serif (clean, legible, professional).

Tech Stack (Strict Enforcement):

Frontend: React 19 + Vite (TypeScript).

Styling: TailwindCSS + clsx + tailwind-merge.

Icons: lucide-react.

Charts: recharts (for analytics curves).

Diagrams: mermaid or react-mermaid2 (for rendering Gemini architectural code).

Backend: Python FastAPI (Create the folder structure and main.py, but mock the data for the UI first).

Core Features & View Requirements:

Global Layout:

A collapsible left sidebar navigation (Icons + Labels).

A top "Global Header" containing the user profile, search bar, and system health status.

Dashboard (Home View):

KPI Cards: Display "Sentiment Score" (Gauge), "Active Priorities" (Number), "New Startups" (Badge).

Velocity Tracker: A Recharts line chart tracking "Sentiment Velocity" over 7 days.

Alerts Feed: A list of "Critical Signals" (e.g., >30% sentiment drop).

Sentiment & Market Analysis View:

A two-column layout.

Left: List of competitors (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.).

Right: Detail view showing xAI Grok analysis (Sentiment Score, Velocity, Hot Topics).

Action: A "Refresh Intelligence" button that simulates triggering Perplexity.

Cloud Intelligence View (The "Gemini" Module):

A visual canvas that renders Mermaid.js diagrams.

Show a dropdown to select one of the 12 Salesforce Clouds (Sales, Service, Marketing, etc.).

Display "Strategic Gaps" and "Ecosystem Shifts" in a side panel next to the diagram.

Adaptive Analysis (LangChain Monitor):

A live log view showing the "Agent Reasoning."

Visual indicator of the strategy being used: "Deep Analysis" (Small Co) vs "Strategic Analysis" (Large Ent).

Strategic Priorities & Startups:

Priorities: A Kanban-style board or Ranked List for internal initiatives.

Startups: A Data Table with columns: Name, Stage, Hiring Velocity, Hot Score. Include a button for "Deep Research" (OpenAI trigger).

Implementation Steps:

Set up the Vite + React + Tailwind project.

Create the Layout component with the Salesforce-style sidebar and header.

Create the Dashboard, Sentiment, CloudIntelligence, and Startup pages.

Use dummy JSON data to populate the charts and tables so the UI is fully interactive immediately.

Important: Ensure the UI looks dense and data-rich (Executive Dashboard style), not sparse.

Tips for Refining the Result
Once Replit generates the initial build, you may want to refine specific areas. Here are follow-up prompts you can use:

For the Charts:

"Update the Recharts on the Dashboard to look more like a financial terminal. Use gradients under the lines (AreaChart) and remove the grid lines for a cleaner look."

For the Cloud Diagrams: "In the CloudIntelligence component, integrate mermaid so that when I switch between 'Sales Cloud' and 'Service Cloud', it renders a different complex architectural diagram representing that ecosystem."

For the "Salesforce" Look: "Refine the buttons and cards. Buttons should have no border-radius (or very slight), and cards should have a subtle top border highlight in blue (border-t-4 border-blue-600) to match standard enterprise dashboard patterns."

Why this prompt works
Explicit "Cosmic" Theme: Salesforce creates "Cosmic" themes for their analytics products (Einstein Analytics); asking for this ensures you get a dark mode that looks professional, not just a generic "dark theme."

Component Mapping: It translates your backend logic (Grok/Perplexity) into specific UI elements (Gauges/Feeds) so the designer knows how to visualize the AI.

Mock Data Strategy: By asking Replit to "mock the data," you get a clickable, beautiful UI immediately without needing the API keys for xAI or Perplexity set up yet.
